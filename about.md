## Lost Sectors Overview 

Every day, a Lost Sector is available at Legend (1550) and Master (1580) difficulty. It's highlighted on the map; you must first clear the LS normally on your current character, even if you cleared it on another character, before it shows up as available for Legend/Master.

This site currently covers details for **Legend** Lost Sectors only.

Daily reset is at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (UTC -7).


## Rewards

- **Rewards**: Exotic armour for your class, weighted towards Exotics that you don't have yet. The armour slot rotates every day. 
- **Drop rate**: has never been confirmed. Commonly thought of as ~20–25% for Legend, ~30–35% for Master.
- **Requirement**: clearing the Lost Sector solo and defeating all champions for Platinum rewards.



## Modifiers

All Legend Lost Sectors have the following modifiers:

- **Elemental Burn**: this element does 50% more damage, both from you and from enemies.
- **Match Game**: enemy shields are very resistant to non-matching elemental damage.
- **Locked Equipment**: you can't change your loadout once you begin.
- **Limited Revives**: you start with a few revives; defeating a champion gets you +1 revive. You wipe when you die with no revives left. Revives no longer work after 15 minutes.
